# Theory of Concurrent Systems

This repository provides some implementations of the theory of concurrent systems

* CCS: this library is supporting Regular CCS and its behavioural semantics (i.e., the generation of a LTS out of a Regular CCS formula)
* HML: this library supports simple HML semantics for finite LTS.
